# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating comprehensive end-to-end (e2e) tests to verify that all existing API endpoints in the application are working correctly. The tests will validate authentication, authorization, data validation, error handling, and proper response formats across all controller endpoints including Auth, Users, and Face Recognition modules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive e2e tests for all authentication endpoints, so that I can ensure the auth system works correctly and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing POST /api/auth/register THEN the system SHALL validate user registration with proper data and return success response
2. WHEN testing POST /api/auth/login THEN the system SHALL authenticate valid credentials and return JWT tokens
3. WHEN testing POST /api/auth/refresh THEN the system SHALL refresh tokens using valid refresh token
4. WHEN testing POST /api/auth/logout THEN the system SHALL invalidate refresh tokens for authenticated users
5. WHEN testing POST /api/auth/change-password THEN the system SHALL update password for authenticated users
6. WHEN testing GET /api/auth/me THEN the system SHALL return current user information for authenticated users
7. WHEN testing GET /api/auth/health THEN the system SHALL return auth service health status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive e2e tests for all user management endpoints, so that I can ensure user CRUD operations work correctly with proper authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing POST /api/users THEN the system SHALL create new users for admin users only
2. WHEN testing GET /api/users THEN the system SHALL return paginated user list for admin/moderator users
3. WHEN testing GET /api/users/me THEN the system SHALL return current user profile for authenticated users
4. WHEN testing GET /api/users/:id THEN the system SHALL return specific user details for admin/moderator users
5. WHEN testing PATCH /api/users/me THEN the system SHALL update current user profile for authenticated users
6. WHEN testing PATCH /api/users/:id THEN the system SHALL update user details for admin users only
7. WHEN testing DELETE /api/users/:id THEN the system SHALL delete users for admin users only
8. WHEN testing PATCH /api/users/:id/deactivate THEN the system SHALL deactivate users for admin users only
9. WHEN testing PATCH /api/users/:id/activate THEN the system SHALL activate users for admin users only
10. WHEN testing PATCH /api/users/me/password THEN the system SHALL update password for authenticated users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive e2e tests for all face recognition endpoints, so that I can ensure face recognition functionality works correctly with proper authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing POST /api/face-recognition/enroll THEN the system SHALL enroll new faces for admin/moderator users
2. WHEN testing POST /api/face-recognition/recognize THEN the system SHALL recognize faces from uploaded images
3. WHEN testing POST /api/face-recognition/recognize-base64 THEN the system SHALL recognize faces from base64 image data
4. WHEN testing GET /api/face-recognition/records THEN the system SHALL return paginated face records
5. WHEN testing GET /api/face-recognition/records/:id THEN the system SHALL return specific face record details
6. WHEN testing PUT /api/face-recognition/records/:id THEN the system SHALL update face records for admin/moderator users
7. WHEN testing DELETE /api/face-recognition/records/:id THEN the system SHALL delete face records for admin users only
8. WHEN testing GET /api/face-recognition/events THEN the system SHALL return face recognition events
9. WHEN testing GET /api/face-recognition/stats THEN the system SHALL return face recognition statistics
10. WHEN testing POST /api/face-recognition/webhook THEN the system SHALL handle webhook events from external systems
11. WHEN testing POST /api/face-recognition/test-connection THEN the system SHALL test Hikvision device connection for admin users
12. WHEN testing GET /api/face-recognition/faces/list THEN the system SHALL return Hikvision face list for admin/moderator users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate proper error handling and security measures, so that I can ensure the API behaves correctly under various error conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing endpoints with invalid authentication THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized responses
2. WHEN testing endpoints with insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden responses
3. WHEN testing endpoints with invalid data THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with validation errors
4. WHEN testing endpoints with non-existent resources THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found responses
5. WHEN testing endpoints with malformed requests THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
6. WHEN testing rate limiting IF implemented THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that verify response formats and data integrity, so that I can ensure API responses are consistent and properly formatted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing successful responses THEN the system SHALL return responses with consistent success format
2. WHEN testing error responses THEN the system SHALL return responses with consistent error format
3. WHEN testing paginated responses THEN the system SHALL include proper pagination metadata
4. WHEN testing authenticated responses THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive data like passwords
5. WHEN testing data creation THEN the system SHALL return created resources with proper IDs and timestamps
6. WHEN testing data updates THEN the system SHALL return updated resources with modified timestamps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test utilities and helpers that support different user roles and scenarios, so that I can efficiently test role-based access control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up tests THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to create test users with different roles
2. WHEN testing authenticated endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to generate valid JWT tokens
3. WHEN testing role-based access THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to test as admin, moderator, and regular users
4. WHEN cleaning up tests THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to clean test data
5. WHEN testing file uploads THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to create mock file data
6. WHEN testing external integrations THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to mock external services
