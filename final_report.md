# Final Report

## 1. Project Analysis

I began by analyzing the monorepo structure, which uses Nx and pnpm workspaces. The project is divided into a Nest.js backend and a Next.js frontend. I examined the dependencies, scripts, and configuration of both the backend and frontend to understand the overall architecture.

## 2. Testing

### 2.1. Backend

I was able to run the backend unit tests after fixing a few issues:

*   **`apps/backend/src/app/users/users.service.spec.ts`**: Fixed a TypeScript error related to mocking the `PrismaService`.
*   **`apps/backend/src/app/auth/services/jwt.service.spec.ts`**: Fixed an incorrect import path and a test that was failing due to an unexpected payload in the JWT.
*   **`apps/backend/src/app/auth/services/auth.service.spec.ts`**: Fixed a `TypeError` by adding a missing method to the mock of the `UsersService`.

The backend integration tests were not run because I was unable to start the database and Redis services using `docker-compose`.

### 2.2. Frontend

I was able to get most of the frontend hook tests to pass after fixing a number of issues:

*   **`useForm` Hook:** I implemented the missing functions in the `useForm` hook, such as `getFieldProps`, `handleSubmit`, `setFieldValue`, `validateForm`, `resetForm`, and `clearErrors`. I also fixed the error handling in the `validateForm` function to correctly extract error messages from Zod's `issues` array.
*   **`useField` Hook:** I rewrote the tests for the `useField` hook to test it directly, without mocking `react-hook-form`.
*   **Specialized Field Hooks:** I rewrote the tests for the specialized field hooks to test them directly, without mocking `react-hook-form`. I also fixed a bug in the `useNumberField` hook.
*   **`FormSchemaBuilder`:** I fixed a bug in the `addField` method of the `FormSchemaBuilder` to correctly handle optional fields.

The frontend component tests for `FaceEnrollmentPage.test.tsx` and `AuthForm.test.tsx` are still failing with a Babel/Jest transformation error. I was unable to resolve this issue, even after trying several different approaches.

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E)

I was unable to run the E2E tests because I was unable to start the frontend and backend servers.

## 3. Code Optimization and Best Practices

### 3.1. Backend

I refactored the `AuthService` to improve error handling, reduce code duplication, and improve type safety. I created a custom exception filter to handle authentication-related errors, and I extracted the password strength validation logic into a private method.

## 4. Recommendations

*   **Fix the frontend component tests:** The Babel/Jest transformation error needs to be resolved so that the component tests can be run.
*   **Fix the backend integration tests:** The database and Redis services need to be started so that the integration tests can be run.
*   **Fix the E2E tests:** The frontend and backend servers need to be started so that the E2E tests can be run.
*   **Continue to refactor the code:** There are still opportunities to improve the code by refactoring it to use more modern best practices. For example, the `any` type is still used in a few places, and there is still some code duplication.
*   **Add more tests:** The test coverage can be improved by adding more tests, especially for the frontend components and the backend integration points.
